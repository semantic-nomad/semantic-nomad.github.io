I'm an Earth and geospatial data scientist working at the intersection of data science, knowledge representation, and machine-aided discovery. Much of my work centers on making Earth and environmental data more findable, interoperable, and meaningful — for humans _and_ machines — by building vocabularies for data interoperability as well as richer semantic models capturing various aspects of domain knowledge. 

I am an Environmental Data Scientist with the [Manaaki Whenua](https://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/) group which is part of the relatively newly minted [Bioeconomy Science Institute](https://www.bioeconomyscience.co.nz/) in Aotearoa New Zealand, where I lead work on custom generative AI tooling, NLP for metadata creation and data-munging, and semantic artifact development (i.e. vocabularies, thesauri, ontologies, etc.). 

I like to think of myself as a [_knowmad_](https://educationfutures.com/post/knowmads-in-society-30/). As such, I am a Fellow at the [Ronin Institute for Independent Scholarship (RIIS) 2.0](https://ronininstitute.org/), reflecting a deep commitment to independent and globally distributed research.  I'm also trying desperately to complete a PhD in the [Department of Environmental Engineering Sciences](https://essie.ufl.edu/ees/) at the University of Florida.

I have been an active contributor to broader Earth science related communities focusing on semantic web and open science for over a decade — co-founding [EarthArXiv](https://eartharxiv.org/), co-chairing ESIP's Semantic Technologies Committee and, more recently, its Soil Ontology and Informatics Cluster, and contributing to the [SWEET ontology](http://sweetontology.net), among others. I am convinced the infrastructure of science matters as much as the discoveries it enables.
